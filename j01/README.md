# Overclocking and Monitoring using MSI Afterburner

Luke Burkhardt 5/4/2023

I have been using [MSI Afterburner](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards) ever since I built my first desktop computer back in 8th grade. This program allows the user to **monitor** and **adjust** important aspects of their computer's hardware and is targeted at performance users and gamers. Initially, I only used Afterburner to monitor temperatures, but quickly realized that it has the ability to **increase my computer's performance** for free. 

MSI Afterburner has the ability to quickly and easily [overclock](https://www.howtogeek.com/165064/what-is-overclocking-the-absolute-beginners-guide-to-understanding-how-geeks-speed-up-their-pcs/) your computer's graphics processor. Overclocking is the process of pushing the clock rate of a processor past its factory speed. This can be related to increasing the boost pressure or ignition timing of an engine to increase horsepower. Overclocking can be applied to a computer's CPU, GPU, RAM, and even motherboard. MSI Afterburner focuses purely on **GPU** (graphics processing unit) overclocking. This is accomplished through the main Afterburner window with a simple slider. Both the core clock and memory clock for the GPU can be adjusted independently of each other using their respective sliders.      

**Efficiency** is one of MSI Afterburner's strong points. On the program's main page shown below, all of the commonly monitored and adjusted attributes such as clock speeds, temperatures, and power usage are presented front and center for the user. With just a quick glance, users can monitor the most critical data regarding their hardware. User defined changes to temperatures, clock speeds, and more can be reverted back to factory specifications with just one click of the "undo" button, making it easy for users to return their system to stable operation.

The small window next to each slider indicates how far the GPU is being overclocked when compared to the factory clock speed of the card. In this instance, Afterburner displays "+106" in the window, indicating that my GPU is operating at 106MHz above the factory clock speed. This is where things can get a bit confusing, and the **learnability** aspect of MSI Afterburner becomes an issue. Without knowing the factory clock speed of your card, it is impossible to know what the effective clock speed of the GPU is set to. Yes, we can see that the clock speed is 106MHz above the factory speed, but where does that land us? This became an issue when I first purchased this GPU. I was under the false impression that this card was shipped from the factory with a 1481MHz clock speed, when in reality the card would see up to 1911MHz without any adjustment of the sliders in MSI Afterburner. Trying to achieve a 1800MHz core clock, I set the slider in Afterburner to +319MHz (1481 + 319 = 1800). In reality, I was asking the GPU to add 319MHz to the actual 1911MHz of my particular card (1911 + 319 = 2230). I experienced frequent crashes and was convinced I had recieved a faulty GPU until I realized what was actually happening. It would be beneficial for Afterburner to show the user what the base clock of their hardware is next to the slider. This brings us to the next feature of MSI Afterburner, which I quickly realized the importance of.
 
In addition to giving the user the ability to adjust core and memory clocks, MSI Afterburner allows the user to monitor several key data points, including real-time actual core clocks. When I began monitoring my GPU clocks, I noticed that it was significantly higher than I was anticipating and **realized that the issue was user error and not a faulty GPU**.

The **usefulness** of MSI Afterburner is proven with my personal experience of an overheating graphincs card. Although modern hardware has temperature limits and will [thermal throttle](https://www.techspot.com/article/1638-what-is-thermal-throttling/) accordingly, running a GPU at its maximum temperature will decrease its lifespan and should be avoided. I noticed that my GPU was constantly running at its temperature limit of 90 degrees celsius, and was reducing my clock speed. This was decreasing both the performance and lifespan of my card, so I decided to install a liquid cooler to the GPU. Through Afterburner's temperature monitoring, I was able to [immediately verify] that this had fixed my temperature issue, and that card was now averaging a cool 54 degrees celsius under load.
